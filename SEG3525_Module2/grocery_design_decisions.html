<h3> SEG3525 Module 2 Grocery Lab Design Decisions Discussion</h3>
<p>
    When the user indicates that they want to see organic products, it displays both the organic and the non organic
    product with check boxes.This is done to allow the user maximum flexibility by
    enabeling them to order both products if they so choose to.
    <br><br>

    When it comes to sorting the product items by price, the organic price is not used to determine price ranking.
    Organic prices are not considered in the ranking since the ranking targets price concious consumers, and they are
    unlikely to purchase organic items.
